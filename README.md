One click resolution and refresh rate changer for a monitor

Place a file named config.txt in the same folder as the .exe in this format ```<monitor number> <width> <height> <refresh rate>``` so like 2 1920 1080 60 will change my monitor 2 to 1080@60

You can swap back and forth with the original settings by using 2 lines so for instance using 

1 2560 1440 144


1 1920 1080 144 

will swap my resolution to 1080p at the first run and back to 1440p when run again
